## üéØ Understanding Prompt Engineering

### What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective prompts to communicate with AI systems, ensuring clear, specific, and actionable responses that lead to desired outcomes.

### Key Principles
1. **Clarity**: Be specific and unambiguous
2. **Context**: Provide sufficient background information
3. **Iteration**: Build upon previous responses
4. **Specificity**: Ask for exact outcomes
5. **Feedback**: Provide clear feedback on results

## üöÄ Prompt Engineering Strategies Used

### 1. Progressive Refinement Strategy

#### Pattern: Start Broad, Then Specific
```
Initial Prompt: "can you build a minimal app for me?"
Refined Prompt: "the app show unknown city and 0 temp. check json file from api call"
```

**Strategy**: Begin with general requirements, then progressively refine based on issues encountered.

**Benefits**:
- Allows AI to understand the full scope
- Enables iterative problem-solving
- Prevents overwhelming with too many details upfront

### 2. Problem-Specific Prompting

#### Pattern: Identify Issue + Request Solution
```
Problem: "the app show unknown city and 0 temp"
Solution Request: "add better error handling"
```

**Strategy**: Clearly identify the problem, then request specific solutions.

**Key Elements**:
- **Problem Description**: What's not working
- **Expected Behavior**: What should happen
- **Solution Request**: What type of fix is needed

### 3. Context-Aware Prompting

#### Pattern: Reference Previous Work + New Request
```
Context: "excellent work! now commit git"
New Request: "commit to v0.3 then add tests"
```

**Strategy**: Acknowledge previous work and build upon it.

**Benefits**:
- Maintains continuity
- Shows appreciation for AI's work
- Provides clear progression path

### 4. Technical Specification Prompting

#### Pattern: Technical Detail + Implementation Request
```
Specification: "change api from openweather to weatherapi new key: 8156607bbd97459c9bc94450252607"
Implementation: "apply changes"
```

**Strategy**: Provide specific technical details, then request implementation.

**Key Elements**:
- **Technical Details**: Exact specifications
- **Implementation Request**: Clear action needed
- **Validation**: How to verify the change

### 5. Quality Assurance Prompting

#### Pattern: Review Request + Specific Focus
```
Review: "review codebase. anything needs refractor?"
Focus: "focus on the database and integration test issues"
```

**Strategy**: Request review, then focus on specific areas of concern.

**Benefits**:
- Systematic quality improvement
- Targeted problem-solving
- Efficient use of AI capabilities

- Focuses on specific improvements
- Maintains technology stack

### 3. Creative Prompting

#### Pattern: Encourage Creativity
```
"Commit the final test fixes and give it a name with 'Vibe' and weather. be creative."
```

**Benefits**:
- Encourages innovative solutions
- Makes development more engaging
- Creates memorable milestones

### 4. Feedback Loop Prompting

#### Pattern: Acknowledge + Build
```
"excellent work! now [next action]"
```

**Benefits**:
- Maintains positive momentum
- Provides clear next steps
- Acknowledges AI's contributions
